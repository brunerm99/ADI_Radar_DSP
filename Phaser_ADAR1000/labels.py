# Create device handle for a single ADAR1000 with the channels configured in a 1x4 array.
# Instantiation arguments:
#     chip_id: Must match the ADAR1000 label in the device tree. i.e. "BEAM0" for ADDR0=low, ADDR1=low
#
#     array_element_map: Maps the array elements to a 1x4 array. See below:
#         (El. #1)    (El. #2)    (El. #3)    (El. #4)
#
#     channel_element_map: Maps the ADAR1000's channels to the array elements. See below:
#         Ch. #1 -> El. #2
#         Ch. #2 -> El. #1
#         Ch. #3 -> El. #4
#         Ch. #4 -> El. #3

# In this example, assume 8 elements, linearly spaced.  BEAM0 is elements 1-4, BEAM1 is elements 5-8.
# Elements are arrayed from left to right.  The ADAR1000 layout is such that channel 1 is the first element, channel 0 is the second,
# channel 4 is the third, and channel 3 is the fourth
