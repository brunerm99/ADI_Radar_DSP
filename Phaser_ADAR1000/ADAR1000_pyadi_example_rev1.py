# Simple testing of the XMW Phased Array Cube with the ADAR1000
# ADAR1000 python use info is here:  https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/pyadi-iio/devices/adi.adar1000.html
# Examples here:  https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio/tree/master/examples

# From the device tree:
# BEAM0 = ADAR1000@0, ADDR 0x00, CS=GPIO8
# BEAM1 = ADAR1000@1, ADDR 0x00, CS=GPIO7
# BEAM2 = ADAR1000@2, ADDR 0x00, CS=GPIO27
# BEAM3 = ADAR1000@3, ADDR 0x00, CS=GPIO22

# The driver uses readback on the ADAR1000.  So make sure that MISO/CIPO is connected to ADAR1000 SDO and MOSI/COPI is connected to ADAR1000 SDIO

import adi
from ADAR_pyadi_functions import *   #import the ADAR1000 functions (These all start with ADAR_xxxx)

# Create device handle for a each ADAR1000
# Instantiation arguments:
#     chip_id: Must match the ADAR1000 label in the device tree (i.e. "BEAM0")
#     array_element_map: Maps the array elements to a 1x4 array. See below:
#         (El. #1)    (El. #2)    (El. #3)    (El. #4)
#     channel_element_map: Maps the ADAR1000's channels to the array elements. See below:
#         Ch. #1 -> El. #2
#         Ch. #2 -> El. #1
#         Ch. #3 -> El. #4
#         Ch. #4 -> El. #3

# Each XMW ADAR1000 board has 4 elements, linearly spaced.  BEAM0 is elements 1-4, BEAM1 is elements 5-8.
# The ADAR1000 layout is such that channel 1 is the first element, channel 0 is the second,
# channel 4 is the third, and channel 3 is the fourth
