# ADI Radar DSP

***

### This is a collection of signal processing functions for the Analog Devices Inc. ADAR1000-based FMCW radar boards. All of my contributions are under the directory ```Bruner_Thesis/```. To use it an anaconda environment is provided as ```Bruner_Thesis/phaser.yml```. It does not include the `adi` python library which should be installed separately and linked via your `PYTHONPATH`. It will also be useful for the functions in `Bruner_Thesis/Phaser_Board/` to add `Bruner_Thesis/` to your `PYTHONPATH`.
